Eventcache is a PHP class for caching that:
 - Is very fast
 - Supports multiple backends (memcache, apc, redis, file)
 - Is very easy to implement
 - Doesn't care about your framework
 - Tries to solve the invalidation problem by using events & triggers

On the  I held a [presentation on Eventcache](http://www.slideshare.net/kevinvz/eventcache)
during [the 2nd CakePHP borrel](http://www.cake-toppings.com/2010/10/15/venue-of-the-dutch-cakephp-borrel-event-announced/)
in Utrecht.
It explains what Eventcache does and how you can implement it.
